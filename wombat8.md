- use setup 0
- you need to use some if statments here to compare the current coordinate location to the next and walk in a direction based on the change
- for example, if the x changes by positive 1, then the wombat must walk east
- if the x changes by negative 1, then the wombat must walk west
- if the y changes by positive 1, then the wombat must walk south
- if the y changes by negative 1, then the wombat must walk north



## Homework:

Continue on classwork if it's not finished. Otherwise, no homework. You should spend at least an hour on the homework and you are welcome to work longer than that. Be prepared to tell your teachers what progress you made at home.
